# Session Learnings

- [2026-02-13] (2x) ABB (audiobookbay.lu) rate limits aggressively after ~30 requests in short window — throttles to 0 results. Space requests or add retry delays (5-10s backoff)
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Fuzzy matching: rapidfuzz is drop-in for fuzzywuzzy, supports partial token-sort, faster. Use for title/author/series deduplication
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Open Library API: free, no auth, returns author + series + cover image IDs. Subjects field contains series name (parse carefully, some noise)
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Scorer design: title 50% + author 30% + series 20% baseline, narrator flag adds ±5-15% to individual results. Capped at 100%, penalizes missing narrator when flag set
- [2026-02-13] (1x) --narrator flag logic: when narrator specified, require it to be highest match — title+author+series alone insufficient. Penalizes no-narrator results by 5%, exact match gets +15%
- [2026-02-13] (1x) aria2c already integrated: download() function wired, --seed-time=0 prevents seeding, --bt-stop-timeout=300 kills if stalled 5min
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Interactive vs auto mode: interactive = show picker; auto = --auto flag picks top match automatically, downloads cover + audio to ~/Downloads/audiobooks/<title>/
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Basil integration: JSON CLI output mode cleaner than MCP server or ports/adapters. Agent shells out to `uv run auto-torrent --json`, gets structured results to reason about
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Agent UX blocker: monolithic CLI prevents conversational flow (search → show results → user picks one → download that specific result). Subcommands solve this: `auto-torrent search ...` + `auto-torrent download <magnet> ...`
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Top feature gaps for agent flow: (1) rate-limit error messages so agent knows why it failed, (2) --limit N to reduce noise, (3) --background + status polling for non-blocking downloads
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Subcommands live: `auto-torrent search`, `download <magnet> --title`, `status [id]`. Background downloads use `Popen`, PID liveness check for status, state files in `~/.auto-torrent/downloads/`
- [2026-02-13] (1x) ABB connection errors now surfaced: custom `ABBError` exception + pretty CLI output ("is not responding", "is unreachable", "returned an error"). JSON mode returns `{"error": "..."}` for agent reasoning
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Rate limiting tactics implemented in order of impact: (1) random delays 1.5-3s between ABB requests (biggest win), (2) requests.Session with 10-conn pool (reuse TCP), (3) retry + backoff on 429/5xx (exponential, 3x), (4) requests-cache SQLite 1hr expiry (local caching), (5) pre-filter candidates before detail fetch (--limit 5 now enriches ~10 not 50+)
- [2026-02-13] (1x) ABB site reliability: goes offline periodically (connection timeouts). Code gracefully degrades with error messages. When back up, new protections prevent throttling during normal usage
- [2026-02-13] (1x) !! BitTorrent trackers age poorly — openbittorrent.com, opentor, ccc.de, coppersurfer, leechers-paradise all dead. Use ngosang/trackerslist for current active list, rotate periodically
- [2026-02-13] (1x) DHT/PEX/LPD essential for modern torrent connectivity — `--enable-dht=true`, `--enable-pex=true`, `--enable-lsd=true` in aria2c. Trackers alone insufficient, DHT bootstraps via fallback peers
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Torrent quality scoring: seeders (log-scale 0-30pts), source (25), resolution (20), uploader trust (15), codec (5), HDR (5). Parse title regex for resolution/source/codec/HDR. Distance-based resolution preference: preferred=20pts, ±1 step=12, ±2=5, ±3=2
- [2026-02-13] (1x) TPBResult dataclass frozen, prevents round-trip format→parse. Store raw `size_bytes: int` not formatted string. Compute warnings at search time, not display time
- [2026-02-13] (1x) TPB safety features: category filter, min_seeds threshold, size warnings (show in results), post-download suspicious extension scan (.exe/.bat/.msi/.ps1 etc)
- [2026-02-13] (1x) aria2c `CN:0 SD:0` = zero connections/seeds — indicates tracker failures, not peer absence. Fix trackers or enable DHT/PEX/LPD
- [2026-02-13] (1x) !! iina-cli has known bug with HTTP URL parsing (GitHub #3688) — shows "URL invalid" + auth dialog. Use `open "iina://weblink?url=<url>"` instead of iina-cli CLI, returns immediately (fire-and-forget)
- [2026-02-13] (1x) iina fire-and-forget launch via `open` — player_proc returns None, need to handle in main loop. Don't track iina's PID
- [2026-02-13] (1x) HTTP server handling iina seeks/closes: ConnectionResetError floods stderr. Create custom `_QuietHTTPServer(ThreadingHTTPServer)` with no-op `handle_error()` to suppress
- [2026-02-13] (1x) iina streaming buffering: add `--mpv-cache=yes --mpv-demuxer-max-bytes=50M --mpv-network-timeout=30` flags for HTTP Range stream playback, prevents "perma loading"
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Code simplification wins: remove section header comments (file already small), obvious docstrings (repeat function name), redundant guards, inline single-use vars. stream.py 551→505 lines (-46)
- [2026-02-13] (1x) !! TitleInfo NamedTuple pattern: `parse_title()` → typed return enables attribute access in callers, prevents silent key-miss crashes
- [2026-02-13] (1x) TPB API response handling: guard with `try/except (ValueError, TypeError)` around `int()` conversions — malformed items silently skipped
- [2026-02-13] (1x) TPB scoring constants consolidated: moved `_SOURCE_SCORES`, `_STATUS_SCORES`, `_RES_LADDER`, distance map, codec scores to config.py with `TPB_` prefix. Pattern enables testing and reuse
- [2026-02-13] (1x) stream.py MIME type: use `mimetypes.guess_type()` fallback to "video/mp4" — supports .mkv/.avi/.webm, not just MP4
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Process death detection: check for files in download directory (`path.exists() and any(path.iterdir())`) not just PID. Empty dir = failed, files = completed
- [2026-02-13] (1x) SOCKS5 DNS leaks: use `socks5h://` not `socks5://` — `h` resolves DNS on proxy side, prevents ISP seeing domain lookup
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Proxy config pattern: flag > env var > config file. Config file at `~/.auto-torrent/config.json` (outside repo) holds credentials safely. Same on local + server deployment
- [2026-02-13] (1x) DataImpulse residential proxy ($5 intro, $50/year full): ~440ms latency acceptable for ABB searches (HTTP only, not torrents). Pool quality varies by country (98% India, 32% Australia, 78% US)
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Basil server auto-torrent deployment: clone repo, `uv sync`, create `~/.auto-torrent/config.json` with proxy creds. Server calls via `cd ~/auto-torrent && uv run auto-torrent search --json --limit 3`. Git pull + uv sync for updates
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Basil MCP integration: create tool domain in `src/agent/tools/audiobooks.ts` + register in `index.ts`. Shell out via `execFile(UV_PATH, ['run', 'auto-torrent', ...])` with `{ cwd: PROJECT_DIR, maxBuffer: 1MB, timeout: 60s }`. Parse JSON, surface `{ error }` as throw for `createDomainExecutor` → `toolError()`
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Background downloads design: Basil tools always use `--bg --json`, return download ID + PID + path. Agent polls `check_download_status` (no blocking on aria2c). Download progress tracked via state files in `~/.auto-torrent/downloads/`
- [2026-02-13] (1x) MCP tool naming convention: `search_audiobooks`, `download_audiobook`, `check_download_status`. Basil MCP auto-discoverable as `mcp__basil__<tool_name>`. No prompt engineering needed
- [2026-02-13] (1x) OL query fuzzing: "Wise Man's Fear" fails, "The Wise Man's Fear" succeeds. Try variations: strip articles (The/A/An), strip subtitle (split on `:` / ` - `). `_query_variations()` tries each until one returns results
- [2026-02-13] (1x) ABB direct fallback: if OL returns None or throws, search ABB directly with raw query (skip OL enrichment). Results still get detail page fetching + scoring. Prevents hard abort on OL failure
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Error propagation: top-level try/except in cmd_search catches uncaught exceptions. JSON mode outputs `{"error": "Type: message"}` to stdout. Non-JSON prints to stderr, exit code 1. Prevents empty stderr crashes in basil execFile
- [2026-02-13] (1x) Basil timeout: ABB detail enrichment (5-10 pages at 440ms each) can exceed 60s. Increased to 120s. Also affects stream() and download() calls via same execFile wrapper
- [2026-02-14] (1x) OL query noise stripping: "graphic audio", "unabridged", "abridged", "narrated by", "read by", "full cast" + trailing digits confuse OL. `_clean_query()` strips via regex before `_query_variations()`. Fixes "red rising 1 graphic audio" → "A Tale of Two Cities" false match
- [2026-02-14] (1x) OL series subjects have `franchise:` prefix — detect and strip ("franchise:Red Rising" → "Red Rising")
- [2026-02-14] (1x) Parallel DHT peer probing: single libtorrent session + multiple magnet adds = shared DHT routing table. Early exit on first peer found (~3-5s for seeded torrents). Batch probe top 3 candidates, pick highest-scored with peers. Fallback to top match if none have peers
- [2026-02-14] (1x) !! Two separate BitTorrent stacks = peer discovery wasted. Probe finds 6 peers via DHT, then aria2c starts fresh session, can't see peers. Real fix: reuse probe session for download (libtorrent instead of aria2c)
- [2026-02-14] (1x) LLM result disambiguation: equally-scored results ("Red Rising" book 1 vs book 6 both 100% match on title+author). `claude -p --json-schema` with Sonnet picks best result from list (understands intent without regex). Returns selected index for agent
- [2026-02-14] (1x) CLI entry point aliasing: `_build_parser(prog, default_source)` → `main_atb()`, `main_atv()` entry points set command defaults (ABB for books, TPB for video). Backward-compatible `main()` stays generic. uv tool install makes aliases global (no `uv run` prefix)
- [2026-02-14] (1x) Help text distinction: `stream` subcommand takes magnet URIs, not search queries. Use `search --stream` for combined search+stream flow. Clarify in help to avoid "unsupported URL protocol" confusion
- [2026-02-14] (1x) Pydantic-settings env var list handling: must use JSON format (`'["item1","item2"]'`) not space-separated when setting array fields via environment. systemd `EnvironmentFile` passes raw strings, needs JSON encoding for lists
- [2026-02-14] (1x) Systemd `EnvironmentFile` + pydantic-settings: redundant when BaseSettings reads `.env` from CWD. Removed to simplify boot sequence
- [2026-02-14] (1x) systemd user service vs system service: user-level runs as unprivileged user (oscar), no password prompt on service restart. Use `systemctl --user` not `sudo systemctl`. Services auto-restart after crash
- [2026-02-14] (1x) Systemd path issues: `WorkingDirectory` must be explicit — service doesn't inherit shell $HOME. Set to absolute path to ensure `uv run` finds deps correctly
- [2026-02-14] (1x) `uv run` in systemd: full path required (`/home/oscar/.local/bin/uv`) — systemd doesn't load shell profile, $PATH is minimal. Same issue as worker systemd units
- [2026-02-15] (1x) !! Opus 4.6 SMS classification: `claude -p --json-schema` with `--max-turns 3` (not 2) — model needs extra turn when JSON schema has complex fields (suggestions array). `--max-turns 2` hits `error_max_turns`, loses `structured_output` key in response
- [2026-02-15] (1x) SMS action fallback: `classification.get("action")` returns None (not missing key), so `.get("action", "search")` doesn't catch. Must check `if not classification.get("action")` or provide explicit None handler
- [2026-02-15] (1x) Twilio webhook timeout: LLM calls (Opus ~10-15s) block TwiML response (15s limit). Retryer re-triggers if timeout → duplicate processing. Moved LLM parsing to background worker, TwiML returns instantly with neutral "give me a moment" reply
- [2026-02-15] (1x) Conversational suggestions state: in-memory dict keyed by phone number, suggestions + 10min TTL. LLM sees pending suggestions as context on next message. Worker clears state on expiry. Acceptable for single-user SMS (mum)
- [2026-02-15] (1x) SMS dedup logic: skip "Found! Downloading..." if download completes within first poll interval (15s). Check during worker's first status check, omit message if already completed. Prevents back-to-back "Found" + "Ready" texts
- [2026-02-15] (1x) Neutral TwiML reply: use "Got it! Give me a moment..." instead of action-specific text. Works for search/suggest/reply without confusion. Worker sends action-specific updates (e.g., "How about one of these?")
- [2026-02-15] (1x) !! Deploy kills background tasks: `git push` → webhook restart → SIGTERM all workers → in-flight searches abort. Results in "Couldn't find" SMS to user. Either skip deploys during active downloads or accept as trade-off (user resends)
- [2026-02-21] (1x) !! LLM_TIMEOUT 30→90s: `claude -p --json-schema` subprocess needs time for cold start + API latency. At 30s, parse calls timeout consistently on first run. 90s gives headroom for ~10s parse + retries
- [2026-02-21] (1x) ABB search timeout 15→45s: proxy adds ~29s per request (slow but stable). Direct connection times out on search endpoint (server IP blocked), proxy is only path forward
- [2026-02-21] (1x) DataImpulse proxy format: `login__cr.COUNTRY_CODE` (double underscore) enables country targeting. `__cr.gb` for UK IPs — better pool quality than rotating all countries. Format: `http://login__cr.gb:password@proxy.address:port`
